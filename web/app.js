//HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol, a system of established rules and procedures for distributing media on the web
//A URL (Universal Resource Locator) is an address that refers to a specific resource on the web
//DNS (Domain Name System) is a collection of names (IP addresses) for web resources
//A query string is a set of characters passed at the end of a URL to specify more specific information about the GET request
//GET requests are HTTP requests that don't seek to modify server data, whereas POST requests are HTTP requests that do attempt to modify server data
//An HTTP request is an event where a client attempts to access some resource on a server
//An HTTP response is an event where a hosting server provides some resource to a client request
//HTTP headers are like key-value pairs that indicate information that was requested by the browser. Some headers include the date, length of content, or even language 
//When a URL is clicked, an HTTP request is made to a server which responds by (optimally) displaying the content native to that requested resource
